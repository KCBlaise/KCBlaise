# BLAISE OKOYECHIRA - FRONTEND DEVELOPER

## Welcome 👋

Hi, I'm Blaise Okoyechira, and welcome to my GitHub profile.

I hope you enjoy your journey through my profile and repositories	😄.

## About Me

Great to see you're interested in getting to know me 😄. I'm currently a junior level frontend developer working on projects to improve my skill level. One of my favourite repositories so far is my [Tic-Tac-Toe Project](https://github.com/KCBlaise/Tic-Tac-Toe).

While it may not be the best work I have done, it is a project that helped me to master the fundamentals (vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript). Without any design or style guide, functionality was the primary purpose of the project and that was achieved.

Sorry I got carried away 😄, you're still here for me and not just my work. Some of my favorite people/things in the world are Manchester United ❤️, LeBron James 👑, and the MCU 🎥.

Now let's take a look at what I can do.
